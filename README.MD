A simple, scalable, and powerful full‑stack architecture designed for production‑ready web applications – now applied to the mission of stray animal rescue.  
In the React ecosystem, flexibility is a double‑edged sword: while it allows endless possibilities, without a clear architecture it can lead to messy, inconsistent, and hard‑to‑maintain code bases.  
This project aims to provide that architecture by combining modern technology (React + NestJS) with real‑world requirements (scaled teams, deployable infrastructure, and meaningful impact).

## 🎯 Why this project?

- **Purpose‑Driven**: PawHaven is not just a sample project—it’s a nonprofit initiative committed to rescuing stray animals.  
- **Enterprise‑Ready Stack**: Comes with clear structure, best practices, and end‑to‑end full stack using React & NestJS.  
- **Real‑world Challenges**: Tackles issues like team collaboration, modular codebase, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, scalability.  
- **Educational Resource**: Designed for developers who want to level up to large‑scale TypeScript applications.
