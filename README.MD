## ‚ú® What is this?

PawHaven is a full-stack project built with React and Node.js (NestJS). It provides hands-on experience with modern web development, covering React and NestJS best practices, full-stack JavaScript development, and DevOps workflows. At the same time, PawHaven is a nonprofit initiative dedicated to stray animal rescue. My goal is to leverage technology to encourage more people to take part in rescue efforts. I currently maintain the project on my own and welcome collaborators who share the same passion to join and make PawHaven truly impactful for stray animals.
