### ✨ What is this?

This project is a fullstack application built with [**React**](https://github.com/aoda-zhang/fullStack-frontEnd) (frontend) and [**NestJS**](https://github.com/aoda-zhang/fullStack-backEnd) (backend), implementing a modular, scalable architecture with a clear separation of concerns.

It leverages a modern toolchain aligned with [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)'s recommended technologies to ensure high code quality, maintainability, and performance. The backend and frontend are fully decoupled yet seamlessly integrated for API communication and shared logic patterns.
